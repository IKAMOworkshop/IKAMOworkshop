# About Me

Hello there, I'm Jeremy Chang!👋
I am a creative developer (well, at least aspiring) focusing on front-end development and WebGL.
I'm very interested in building immersive experience with visual and motion.

## Fun Facts

- 🖌️ I like to draw on my free time.
- 💻 I can speak three different languages: English, Mandarin, and Japanese.
- 🏠 Although born in LA, I spent most of my life growing up in Taiwan.

Anyways, thanks for dropping by!
