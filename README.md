# About Me

Hello there, I'm Jeremy Chang!👋
I started as a designer fascinated by all the visuals, and now, I'm expanding my skillset by teaching myself about front-end development.
I'm always inspired by a variety of projects, which is also one of the reasons and motives for me to begin my developer journey seeing all the incredible and immersive websites.

## Fun Facts

- 🖌️ I like to draw and am currently learning to draw in my free time.
- ✈️ Finding work and relocating to Japan is one of my life goals.
- 💻 I can speak three different languages: English, Mandarin, and Japanese.
- 🏠 Although born in LA, I spent most of my life growing up in Taiwan.

Anyways, thanks for dropping by!
